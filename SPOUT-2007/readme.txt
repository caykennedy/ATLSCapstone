SPOUT

"Spout" is a video frame sharing system for Microsoft Windows which allows applications to share OpenGL and DirectX textures between each other in a similar way to Syphon for the Mac. For compatible graphics hardware, textures are shared by way of DirectX using the NVIDIA DirectX/OpenGL interop extension.

Included with the Spout distribution are :

  o SpoutSettings - a program to select settings for Spout
  o SpoutPanel - a sender selection dialog that can be used by Spout receivers
  o Sender and receiver demonstration programs
  o Visual Studio runtime installation
